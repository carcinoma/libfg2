libfg2 - Simple Linux video capture library
===========================================

Libfg2 is a C library which provides access to video input devices such as
frame grabber cards, webcams, and TV tuner devices under kernels which support
Video4Linux2.  Using the excellent libv4l library, libfg2 provides access to 
most devices, independent of which pixel formats they use.  Libfg2 also 
provides functions to convert video frames to popular in-memory formats such 
as those used by Gtk+, SDL, Imlib2, and OpenCV.

The library began with me hacking on the libfg library to support the 
Video4Linux2 API.  I just started going through each function modifying each
one to work with V4L2, renaming a few things along the way, and Libfg2 is the
result.

Libfg2 is not presently ready for distribution since a fair portion of the code
hasn't been thoroughly tested (or written for that matter), a proper 
build-system is missing, documentation is incomplete (big surprise!), and the 
API is not stable at all.

If you want to hack on libfg2 it shouldn't be very difficult.  The code is
quite simple and the really important stuff is in: 
    
    include/libfg2.h 
    src/capture.c 
    src/control.c
    src/convert.c
    src/frame.c 

To build libfg2 at present, you'll need SCons besides the usual stuff.  In
general, the following sequence should work:

    1. Install dependencies
          Required: libv4l
          Recommended: JPEGlib
          Optional: SDL, Gtk+, Imlib2, OpenCV (if you want support for these)
    2. Checkout source code and 'cd' into source dir
    3. Run 'scons --help' and check out the "Local Options"
    4. Run 'scons' (with any desired options)
    5. Hack and slash (see examples: camview, example, test)

Please send me your hacks.
